# Estrus-detection-and-health-indicators-of-dairy-cattle

Artificial insamination has pushed the limits of livestock farming in everywhere. In order to detect the correct period for artificial insemination we need to know the estrus period (more oftenly known as heat). This period can be detected using several behavioural indicator.By using a inertial measurement unit we tried to capture cow's movement all day long and recognised pattern using signal processing. 

This repository contains information regarding that. 

For movement capture we used Arduino nano, MPU6050, BLE (Bluetooth with low energy)

For sending it over cloud we using raspberry pi zero 2 w and hosted mqtt server on it.
